## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `sqlode --help` no longer renders the same usage information
  twice. Previously a manually-authored `global_help` block printed
  first, followed by glint's auto-generated `USAGE: / SUBCOMMANDS:`
  layout — same content, two formats. The manual block is
  removed; glint's auto-generated layout is now the single source
  of truth, so the two views cannot drift. Per-subcommand help
  (`sqlode generate --help`, `sqlode init --help`, etc.) continues
  to use each command's `glint.command_help(...)` block, which
  already carried the auto-discovery and example details that the
  removed global block duplicated. (#467)
- The CLI now rewrites the previous misleading
  `command not found` diagnostic into a class-specific message that
  names the actual failure mode:
  - no arguments →
    `error: missing subcommand. Run 'sqlode --help' to see available
    commands.`
  - leading-dash argument (e.g. `--xyz`, `-h`, `--version`) →
    `error: unrecognized option '<arg>'. Run 'sqlode --help' to see
    available options.`
  - non-flag, non-subcommand argument (e.g. `foo`) →
    `error: unknown subcommand '<arg>'. Run 'sqlode --help' to see
    available commands.`

  The rewriting is in `sqlode.rewrite_error` and is pinned by tests;
  errors that did NOT originate from glint's `command not found`
  path (config-load failures, generate-time errors, etc.) reach the
  user verbatim. (#466)
- The CLI now sends error diagnostics (unknown flag / no-args /
  invalid subcommand) to **stderr** with exit code 1, matching the
  POSIX/CLIG convention. Pipelines like
  `sqlode | jq` no longer receive help-as-error noise on jq's
  stdin, and `sqlode <bad> 1>out 2>err` cleanly separates
  requested output from diagnostics. Explicit `--help`
  invocations still print to stdout (the help text is the
  requested output in that case). The dispatch is implemented in
  `sqlode.main`, which now drives `glint.execute` itself instead
  of going through `glint.run`. (#465)
- The CLI now emits ANSI escape codes in `--help` output only when
  stdout is connected to an interactive terminal AND the
  `NO_COLOR` environment variable is unset (or set to the empty
  string). `sqlode --help > file.txt`, `sqlode --help | less`, and
  `NO_COLOR=1 sqlode --help` no longer leak colour control
  sequences into non-ANSI consumers, matching the convention from
  <https://no-color.org/> and CLIG. The decision logic is in
  `cli.decide_color_emission` and is pinned by tests; the BEAM
  primitives are wrapped in a small `sqlode_ffi.erl` module.
  (#464)

### Fixed

- Generated `params.gleam` no longer imports the unused `None` /
  `Some` constructors from `gleam/option`; only `type Option` is
  pulled in (the rendered code only references the type itself).
  Generated `<engine>_adapter.gleam` now narrows its
  `gleam/option` import to what the file actually references —
  `{type Option}` when only nullable params/results force the
  type, and the full `{type Option, None, Some}` only when at
  least one query is `:one` / `:batchone` and the wrapper actually
  emits `Some(row) / None`. Downstream callers running with strict
  warnings (e.g. glinter `warnings_as_errors = true`, which sqlode
  itself uses) no longer have to suppress unused-import warnings on
  `// DO NOT EDIT` files. **Re-run `sqlode generate` to refresh
  existing `params.gleam` / `<engine>_adapter.gleam` files —
  previously generated copies still carry the broad import.**
  (#463)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Placeholder syntax is validated per engine before analysis**
  (#459). `sqlode verify` / `generate` now reject placeholder styles
  that do not belong to the configured engine — MySQL `@name` /
  `:name` / `?N`, PostgreSQL `?` / `:name` / `$name`, etc. — with a
  diagnostic that names the offending token and lists the accepted
  forms. Previously the unsupported styles either survived into
  generated SQL unchanged or surfaced as late, misleading type
  inference errors.
- **Wrong-engine UPSERT tails are rejected at parse time** (#460).
  `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` under PostgreSQL / SQLite and
  `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE / NOTHING` under MySQL now fail fast
  with a clear diagnostic, instead of being silently copied into
  the generated query. The emitted SQL can no longer disagree with
  the configured engine.
- **Sparse SQLite numbered placeholders are rejected** (#461).
  `?N` indices must now form a contiguous set starting at `?1`, so
  queries that write `?2` without `?1`, or skip from `?1` to `?3`,
  are caught before codegen. Previously the parser accepted them
  while emitting metadata (`param_count`, param layout) that did
  not honour the declared placeholder indices.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **`verify` and `generate` share one post-parse validation path**
  (#441, #443). The duplicate-name / unsupported-annotation /
  array-engine / native-`:execresult` checks now live in a single
  `sqlode/query_validation` module so `sqlode verify` rejects every
  config `sqlode generate` would reject — the two commands can no
  longer drift. `verify` also flags normalized query-name collisions
  (e.g. `GetUser` and `get_user` both producing the same
  `get_user` / `GetUserParams` / `GetUserRow` identifiers) before
  codegen is allowed to emit duplicate Gleam declarations.
- **`.sql` path expansion shared across commands** (#440). Directory
  entries for `schema` / `queries` now expand through a shared
  `sqlode/sql_paths` helper, so `sqlode verify` accepts the same
  directory-based configs `sqlode generate` already supports and
  produces the same empty-directory diagnostics.
- **Release workflow runs glinter** (#442). The tag-driven
  `release.yml` build job now runs `gleam run -m glinter` alongside
  format / type-check / test / shellspec, matching `just all` and
  the PR CI contract. Release artifacts are now validated against
  the same quality bar contributors are asked to satisfy.

### Fixed

- **`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`** (#448). The
  idempotency modifier is now stripped before the column definition
  is parsed, so PostgreSQL migrations that use the common
  `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` (and `ADD IF NOT EXISTS`) forms apply
  cleanly instead of failing with a misleading
  `missing type for column if` error.
- **`ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE ... USING ...` no longer silently drifts**
  (#447). The new type extractor stops at the trailing `USING`
  cast clause so `TEXT → UUID USING id::uuid` parses, and a
  genuinely unrecognized type now surfaces a hard error instead of
  leaving the old type in the catalog without any diagnostic.
- **Raw-runtime decoders honor strong type mapping** (#445). Rich
  scalar decoders (`UUID` / `TIMESTAMP` / `DATE` / ...) are now
  wrapped as `decode.map(<primitive>, models.<Wrapper>)` so raw
  `queries.gleam` produces values the strong-mapped row types can
  consume. Previously the native adapter path wrapped correctly but
  the raw path decoded bare primitives, producing type-incompatible
  generated code.
- **`omit_unused_models` keeps strong / rich helpers for write-only
  queries** (#446). Param rich scalars are now collected separately
  from the catalog, so the `SqlUuid` / `SqlTimestamp` wrappers that
  an `:exec` query references still reach `models.gleam` even when
  pruning drops the underlying table. `params.gleam` and
  `queries.gleam` no longer reference types the generated project
  does not declare.
- **Non-local param types are always imported or qualified** (#444).
  Module-qualified custom types (`myapp/types.UserId`) referenced
  by `prepare_*` helpers now emit the matching selective import in
  `queries.gleam`, and rich scalars under `rich` / `strong` mapping
  are prefixed with `models.` everywhere outside `models.gleam`.
  The generated project compiles as written without user-written
  follow-up imports.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **First-class Docker distribution path** (#438). `Dockerfile`,
  `scripts/smoke_docker.sh`, and `.github/workflows/docker.yml` now
  build, smoke-test, and publish a container image for sqlode. Users
  can run the CLI via `ghcr.io/nao1215/sqlode` without installing
  Erlang/OTP on the host, and tagged releases publish semver image
  tags in addition to the escript artifact.
- **Tutorial-first SQLite onboarding** (#437).
  `doc/tutorials/getting-started-sqlite.md` now walks through install,
  `sqlode init`, `sqlode generate`, and a minimal `sqlight` runtime
  example end to end. The new `examples/sqlite-basic/` project is the
  runnable counterpart, and `spec/example_spec.sh` keeps the tutorial
  commands from drifting by asserting the generated modules exist.

### Changed

- **README install/reference cleanup**. The top-level README now points
  readers to the SQLite tutorial and runnable example first, documents
  the Docker install path alongside the existing release artifacts, and
  removes decorative callouts in favor of tighter reference prose.

### Fixed

- **`sqlode init --engine=mysql --runtime=native` now works** (#436).
  The stale CLI validation guard that still rejected MySQL native mode
  after v0.5.0 support shipped has been removed. Both Gleam tests and
  ShellSpec coverage now pin the generated config and starter schema
  for the MySQL native path.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **End-to-end MySQL support** (#417 epic; #418, #419, #420, #421,
  #422, #423). MySQL is now a first-class engine in both `raw` and
  `native` runtime modes. The native MySQL adapter targets the
  [`shork`](https://hexdocs.pm/shork/) Hex package. The previous
  config guard rejecting `engine: "mysql"` + `runtime: "native"` is
  gone.
- **Modifier-aware MySQL type contract** (#420). `TINYINT(1)` and
  `BOOLEAN` resolve to `BoolType`, `UNSIGNED` / `SIGNED` /
  `ZEROFILL` noise no longer blocks classification, and a new
  `DecimalType` keeps `DECIMAL` / `NUMERIC` columns lossless (a
  `String` Gleam type) instead of silently collapsing into `Float`.
  MySQL `SET(...)` columns are now first-class `SetType(name)` and
  surface as `List(<Name>Value)` in generated code with
  `_set_to_string` / `_set_from_string` helpers for the comma-joined
  wire format.
- **MySQL migration DDL** (#419). `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN`
  rewrites a column's type and nullability; `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE
  COLUMN` renames and retypes in one step. Multi-file migration
  fixtures see the catalog from previously-parsed files, so an ALTER
  in `002_*.sql` can operate on a CREATE TABLE in `001_*.sql`.
  `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `CHARACTER SET`,
  `COLLATE`, `COMMENT`, and `VISIBLE`/`INVISIBLE` no longer bleed
  into column-type classification. Unsupported MySQL DDL now fails
  with an actionable `UnsupportedMysqlDdl` parse error instead of
  being silently dropped on the floor.
- **MySQL query parity fixtures** (#421). A dedicated MySQL advanced
  fixture pins the supported query subset: backtick-quoted
  identifiers, `LIMIT offset, count`, `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY
  UPDATE` (without phantom params from `VALUES(...)` references), CTE
  + JOIN result-column resolution, and `sqlode.slice` expansion
  through positional placeholders.
- **MySQL integration lanes** (#422). Three integration cases —
  `case_mysql_compile_raw`, `case_mysql_compile_native`, and
  `case_mysql_real` — exercise the generated MySQL adapter against
  pinned dependencies and a live MySQL 8.0 server. CI provisions
  MySQL alongside the existing PostgreSQL service. The live lane
  covers the full CRUD contract plus bytes / decimal / enum / SET
  round-trips.
- **Per-engine/runtime capability matrix** (#423).
  `doc/capabilities.md` now expresses support at engine/runtime
  granularity (raw/native flag plus the Hex driver each native
  adapter imports).
- **MySQL completeness follow-ups** (#430). Closes the gaps the #417
  epic had deferred:
  - `BLOB` / `BINARY` columns round-trip byte-for-byte in native
    mode via a private `@external(erlang, "shork_ffi", "coerce")`
    binding (`bit_array_to_shork`).
  - `SetType` is wired end-to-end through `params.gleam`,
    `queries.gleam`, and `mysql_adapter.gleam` — the new
    `common.qualified_field_type` helper prefixes generated enum /
    set types with `models.` in the consumer modules.
  - A new `<name>_default() -> <EnumType>` helper in `models.gleam`
    gives generated adapter / queries decoders a typed zero for
    `decode.failure`, so the case expression resolves as
    `Decoder(<EnumType>)` instead of `Decoder(String)`.
  - MySQL-native `:execresult` rejection is now pinned by a direct
    `generate_test` case; a positive raw-mode test covers the same
    query shape.
- **Glinter adoption** (#429). The project now runs
  [glinter](https://github.com/pairshaped/glinter) with
  `warnings_as_errors = true` via `just lint` / `just all` and a
  new CI step. 180+ `unnecessary_string_concatenation` findings
  were rewritten as multi-line literals; `discarded_result`,
  `short_variable_name`, `unqualified_import`, `redundant_case`,
  `missing_type_annotation`, and `assert_ok_pattern` violations
  are fixed (single inline `// nolint:` for the compile-time regex
  literals in `naming.new()`).

### Maintenance

- Dependabot version bumps replayed on top of the #417 main:
  `actions/upload-artifact` v4→v7 (#424),
  `actions/download-artifact` v4→v8 (#428),
  `softprops/action-gh-release` v2→v3 (#428).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Engine-aware expression parser with MySQL clause preservation**
  (#405). `expr_parser.parse_stmt` / `parse_select_core` / `parse_expr`
  now accept a `model.Engine` argument. `InsertStmt` grows an
  `on_duplicate_key_update: List(Assignment)` field so MySQL
  `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` survives parsing as first-class IR instead
  of being silently skipped. MySQL's two-argument `LIMIT offset, count`
  form is now recognised and populates `offset` / `limit` in the
  expected order, while PostgreSQL's `LIMIT count OFFSET offset`
  semantics are preserved.
- **First-class MySQL `ENUM(...)` and `SET(...)` columns** (#407).
  Inline `ENUM` and `SET` column types on a MySQL `CREATE TABLE` no
  longer require a type override. `EnumDef` gains an `EnumKind`
  discriminator (`PostgresEnum | MySqlEnum | MySqlSet`). `ENUM`
  columns resolve to `EnumType(<table>_<column>)` and codegen emits
  the same Gleam sum type it has always emitted for PostgreSQL enums.
  `SET` columns resolve to `StringType` as a documented fallback,
  with the allowed values preserved on the catalog `EnumDef` for
  future consumers.
- **`sqlode init` creates missing parent directories** (#402). Running
  `sqlode init --output=./config/sqlode.yaml` used to fail with a
  generic write error when `config/` did not exist; the CLI now
  creates the parent directory and distinguishes directory-creation
  failures from file-write failures in diagnostics.
- **`just regen-capabilities` target** (#403). The capabilities
  snapshot test used to point contributors at a `gleam run -m
  sqlode/scripts/print_capabilities` entry point that did not exist;
  the script and just target are now real, and the failure message
  plus the tracked file header point at `just regen-capabilities`.

### Changed

- **Query analysis now consumes the expression-aware IR end-to-end**
  (#406). `analyze_query` parses the statement once via
  `expr_parser.parse_stmt` and drives parameter equality / `IN` /
  quantified inference from the rich `Expr` tree, plus table-scope
  (CTE / VALUES / derived / alias) extraction from `Stmt.ctes` and
  `SelectCore.from`. Token scanners remain as an explicit fallback
  only for `UnstructuredStmt` and for PostgreSQL / SQLite `ON
  CONFLICT` tails the IR does not yet model. Result: new parser
  features no longer need to be taught in parallel to several
  token scanners.
- **Generated-project compile checks are reproducible** (#404). The
  `spec/compile_spec.sh` harness now seeds each temporary Gleam
  project with a pinned `manifest.toml` copied from a checked-in
  `integration_test/warmup/` project. A new `just integration-prepare`
  target pre-populates the Hex cache and is the single explicit
  online step `just all` requires; `just integration-refresh` refreshes
  the committed pins. `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the online/offline
  contract.

### Fixed

- None.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`sqlode verify` command**: A static verification lane that walks
  every SQL block listed in the config, runs the full schema /
  strict-views / query / analyzer pipeline, and reports every finding
  without writing files. Exits non-zero when any finding is present,
  suitable as a CI gate before `sqlode generate`. The new
  `query_parameter_limit` config option (mirroring sqlc's setting of
  the same name) becomes the first enforced policy — queries whose
  inferred parameter count exceeds the limit produce a finding.
- **Function-first `prepare_<query>` helpers**: Every generated query
  now emits a `prepare_<function_name>(...)` helper that takes the
  params record fields as positional arguments and returns the
  `#(sql, values)` tuple Gleam database drivers consume directly.
  Call sites can now use `queries.prepare_get_author(id: 1)` instead
  of manually composing a query descriptor, a params record, and
  `runtime.prepare`. The low-level descriptor API is preserved for
  batching, caching, or custom wrappers.
- **Expression-aware SQL IR**: Replaced the thin statement IR with a
  normalised IR (`Stmt` / `SelectCore` / `CteDef` / `Expr`) covering
  CTEs, LATERAL, select items, predicates, arithmetic, CASE,
  functions, casts, `IN`, `EXISTS`, `ANY` / `ALL`, window specs, and
  RETURNING. Type inference now operates on the IR instead of
  reverse-engineering semantics from raw token slices, and
  `col = ANY(placeholder)` / sibling quantified patterns now
  participate in parameter inference alongside `IN`. LATERAL subquery
  aliases are treated as nullable when the surrounding join is
  `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN LATERAL`. Four executable fixtures under
  `test/fixtures/complex_sql_*.sql` pin the new behaviour.

### Changed

- **`strict_views: true` is now the default**. A configuration that
  omits `strict_views` previously warned and continued with a partial
  catalog, letting a generated model silently drift away from the
  real database shape. Generation now fails with a `SchemaParseError`
  when a view references an unknown column. Set `strict_views: false`
  to restore the legacy permissive behaviour for schemas that still
  need it.
- RETURNING resolution is now scoped to the DML target table, so
  `INSERT .. SELECT .. RETURNING` no longer sees CTE / SELECT source
  tables as ambiguous candidates.
- The schema parser now accepts non-reserved keywords (`action`,
  `name`, `order`, …) as column identifiers.

### Fixed

- **Ambiguous unqualified parameter columns are now rejected.**
  Parameter inference previously swallowed ambiguity from
  `context.find_column_in_tables` and fell back to the primary
  table, so `WHERE id = $1` in a multi-table query silently bound the
  param type to whichever table came first. Unqualified predicate
  columns that match more than one in-scope table now raise
  `AmbiguousColumnName`. The token scan's FROM scope is also
  restricted to the outermost statement via
  `token_utils.strip_leading_with`, so CTE-internal tables no longer
  leak into the ambiguity check for the outer predicate.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Raw decoder for embedded columns (e.g., `sqlode.embed(table)`) now
  correctly constructs the nested type (e.g., `Author(id:, name:, bio:)`)
  instead of flattening all fields into the outer row constructor.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Destructive DDL support**: The schema parser now applies `DROP TABLE`,
  `DROP VIEW`, `DROP TYPE`, `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`,
  `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` / `RENAME COLUMN`,
  `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE` / `SET NOT NULL` / `DROP NOT NULL`
  to the catalog. Full migration histories with destructive DDL can now
  be processed without consolidating into a snapshot.
- **Ambiguous column detection**: `find_column_in_tables` now errors when
  a bare column name matches in two or more tables, instead of silently
  picking the first match. Use a table qualifier (e.g., `table.column`)
  to resolve the ambiguity.
- **IR-based column inference**: The column inferencer now uses the
  structured IR (`SelectStatement.select_items`, `from`, `joins`) for
  simple SELECT queries, reducing reliance on token-level heuristics.
  Compound queries (UNION/EXCEPT) and `sqlode.embed()` fall back to the
  existing token-based path.
- **Raw decoder generation**: `queries.gleam` now generates standalone
  `*_decoder()` functions for `:one` / `:many` queries in raw mode,
  providing type-safe `decode.Decoder(models.Row)` values without
  requiring a native adapter.

### Fixed

- `sqlode.embed(TABLE)` is now rewritten into a concrete qualified
  column list in the emitted SQL. Previously the literal
  `sqlode.embed(...)` text leaked into generated runtime queries, which
  the database rejected as invalid SQL. Embed detection during column
  inference is also now case-insensitive.
- Table qualifier in `table.column` patterns was silently discarded in
  `resolve_column_type_from_tokens` and
  `resolve_column_type_nullable_from_tokens`, causing lookups to search
  all tables instead of the specified one.
- `sqlc-compatibility.md` incorrectly stated that batch annotations and
  `sqlc.*` prefix were implemented. Updated to reflect actual status.

### Changed

- `UnsupportedStatement` schema parse error removed. Destructive DDL
  statements are now applied rather than rejected.
- README updated to clarify that sqlode is not a drop-in sqlc
  replacement and uses the `sqlode.*` macro prefix exclusively.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Initial sqlc-style code generator for Gleam
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite engine support
- Query annotations `:one`, `:many`, `:exec`, `:execresult`, `:execrows`, `:execlastid` supported end-to-end. `:batchone`, `:batchmany`, `:batchexec`, and `:copyfrom` are parsed for sqlc compatibility but currently fail generation with an unsupported-annotation error.
- sqlode macros: `sqlode.arg`, `sqlode.narg`, `sqlode.slice`, `sqlode.embed`
- Type mapping for INT, FLOAT, BOOL, TEXT, BYTEA, UUID, JSON, TIMESTAMP, DATE, TIME
- PostgreSQL ENUM type support
- Nullable column detection with `Option(T)` wrapping
- Result record types (`models.gleam`) for `:one` and `:many` queries
- Adapter generation for pog (PostgreSQL) and sqlight (SQLite)
- RETURNING clause support for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- CTE (WITH clause) support
- JOIN type inference
- Type overrides and column renames via config
- `init` command with stub `db/schema.sql` and `db/query.sql` creation
- `generate` command with `--config` flag
- Version constant in `version.gleam` as single source of truth
